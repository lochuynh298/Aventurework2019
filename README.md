üí° 
- Components Dominate: The "Components" category consistently shows the highest number of transactions throughout the entire period displayed.
- Accessories Show Volatility: The "Accessories" category experiences significant fluctuations, with peaks and troughs much more pronounced than other categories.
- Bikes Show Relative Stability: The "Bikes" category maintains a relatively low and stable number of transactions across the observed timeframe.
- Clothing Shows Growth and Fluctuation: The "Clothing" category starts with very low transaction numbers but exhibits a noticeable increase starting around mid-2013. It also shows considerable volatility after this growth..

Query 4Ô∏è‚É£:  Evalue number of customer in 2013 by month

```sql
Select month(orderdate) as subsequent_month 
      ,count(distinct(CustomerID)) as number_customer

üí° Significant Growth After Month 5: The number of customers remains relatively stable in the first five months, fluctuating slightly between roughly 300 and 500. However, starting around month 6, there is a sharp and substantial increase in the number of customers


Query 5Ô∏è‚É£:  Query 5: Retention rate of Customer in 2013 with status of Successfully Shipped (Cohort Analysis)

```sql
WITH 
t0 AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2013 and Status = 5
)
, t1 AS (
    SELECT  TotalDue,OrderDate, CustomerID ,  FORMAT( OrderDate , 'yyyy-MM-01' ) Order_Month
    FROM t0
    )
, t2 AS (
    SELECT CustomerID, FORMAT(MIN(OrderDate), 'yyyy-MM-01' ) Cohort_Month
    FROM t0
    GROUP BY CustomerID
)
, t3 AS (
    SELECT t1.*, t2.Cohort_Month, DATEDIFF(month, CAST(t2.Cohort_Month AS date), CAST(t1.Order_Month AS date))+1 AS CohortIndex
    FROM t1
    JOIN t2 ON t1.CustomerID = t2.CustomerID
)
, t4 AS (
    SELECT Cohort_Month, Order_Month, CohortIndex, COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) Count_CustomerID

üí° The cohort analysis reveals a consistent pattern of strong initial sales followed by a significant drop-off. However, there are substantial and recurring spikes in sales value around the 4th and 7th months after the initial purchase across multiple cohorts. This strongly suggests a significant re-engagement driver occurring at these time intervals, likely linked to seasonal purchasing patterns, successful marketing campaigns, or product-related cycles. While re-engagement occurs, sustained high spending beyond these peaks varies, highlighting the importance of understanding and cultivating long-term customer loyalty. The consistent timing of these spikes presents valuable opportunities for targeted marketing and proactive re-engagement strategies to maximize customer lifetime value. Investigating the specific reasons behind these recurring surges is crucial for optimizing business strategies.

Query 6Ô∏è‚É£:  No of order and value at Pending status in 2014

```sql
SELECT
    YEAR(ModifiedDate) AS yr,
    Status,
    COUNT(PurchaseOrderID) AS order_cnt,
    SUM(TotalDue) AS value
FROM
    Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader
WHERE
    YEAR(ModifiedDate) = 2014
    AND Status = 1
GROUP BY
    YEAR(ModifiedDate),
    Status;
```

üí° The significant number of pending orders underscores the necessity of evaluating vendor performance to gauge their efficiency and recommending a revamp of their order processes.


## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations

This SQL project, through its analysis of the AdventureWorks dataset, provided several valuable business insights:

- **Revenue and Quantity Sales**: Identifying Road Bikes Sub-Category with the highest sales revenue  with the highest quantity sales informed inventory and marketing strategies to meet strong market demand. Notable year-over-year growth in Mountain Frames and Socks highlighted growth opportunities.
- **Monthly and Yearly Trends**: 
   1)Strong and Consistent Demand for Components: "Components" are the consistently best-selling category in terms of the number of transactions. This suggests a high volume of smaller purchases or a frequent need for individual parts.

   2)Seasonal or Event-Driven Demand for Accessories: The peaks in "Accessories" sales likely correlate with specific times of the year (e.g., holidays, start of cycling seasons) or promotional events. Analyzing the dates of these peaks could reveal valuable insights for marketing and inventory planning.

   3)Bikes are Likely Higher Value, Lower Volume Purchases: The low transaction volume for "Bikes" is expected as they are typically higher-priced items purchased less frequently than components or accessories. The slight increase at the end might indicate a seasonal trend or a successful campaign.

   4)Growth in Clothing Sales: The significant increase in "Clothing" transactions around mid-2013 suggests a successful expansion of this product line, a shift in customer preferences, or effective marketing efforts. The subsequent fluctuations might indicate seasonal demand for cycling apparel.

- **Customer and Order Management**: Insights into customer retention emphasized the need for improved retention strategies. Observing stock quantity trends and the high number of pending orders underscored the importance of effective inventory and order process management to boost sales revenue.

Overall, this project demonstrated the power of data-driven strategies in optimizing business operations and making informed decisions, enhancing SQL skills, and showcasing the practical applications of data analysis in a business context.
